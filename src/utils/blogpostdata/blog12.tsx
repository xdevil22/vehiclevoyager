          Traveling with pets adds joy and a few unique challenges. Here's how
          to make your trip smooth from start to finish.

        <h3>1. Prep Your Pet for the Road</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Take short practice drives before long trips.</li>
          <li>
            Let your pet explore the RV while it's parked so it feels familiar.

        <h3>2. Choose Campgrounds with Pet Amenities</h3>
        <p>
          Not all RV parks are equally pet-friendly. When booking, look for
          campgrounds that offer fenced dog runs, walking trails, or wash
          stations.

        </p>

          campgrounds that offer supervised pet-sitting services.{" "}
