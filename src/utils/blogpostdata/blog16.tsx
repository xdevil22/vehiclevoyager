        Most rental experiences go smoothly, but some companies, and plenty of
        lesser-known operators, still rely on sneaky tricks to squeeze extra
        money out of travelers. From phantom damage fees to unnecessary
        insurance charges, the wrong rental counter can turn a relaxing trip
        into a financial headache.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news? A few smart habits and booking through trusted,
        transparent platforms can help you steer clear of the worst offenders.
        <br />
        Here are 10 common car rental scams in 2026 and how to avoid every one
        of them.

        <h2>The “Mandatory” Insurance Upsell</h2>

        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          At pickup, the agent insists you must buy their insurance, or you
          can't take the car, even if your credit card already covers you.
        </p>
        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Do your homework before you arrive. Most major travel cards include a
          Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), and companies that specialize in
          rentals like{" "}
          <a
            href="https://outdoorsyinc.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=28&aff_id=2660&source=vehiclevoyager&sub_id=rvinsurance"

            className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
            Roamly Insurance
          </a>{" "}
          offer travel-specific coverage for cars, RVs, and more. Bring proof of
          coverage and politely decline the upsell.
        </p>

        <p>
          Booking through reputable sites helps too, they'll easily let you opt
          out of unnecessary extras during checkout.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>The Phantom Damage Claim</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          Days after returning your rental, you get an email claiming you
          scratched the bumper or dented the door which was damage that was
          already there.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Before driving off, take time-stamped photos and a short video of the
          car from every angle, including the roof and wheels. Do the same at
          drop-off. Ask a staff member to sign off that the car is damage-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peer-to-peer platforms{" "}
          <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
            like Turo
          </a>{" "}
          make this easy; their apps log inspections with timestamps so disputes
          are rare.

        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>The Empty-Tank “Fuel Service” Fee</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          You return the car a few miles short of full, and the company charges
          you an inflated “fuel service” fee, sometimes $9 or $10 per gallon.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Always refill the tank at a nearby station right before drop-off and
          keep the receipt just in case. Look for rental listings that clearly
          state “Full to Full” fuel policies. Transparent providers outline this
          up front, so you're never surprised later.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      </div>{" "}
      <div>
        <h2>Overpriced Toll Pass Programs</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          You're offered a daily toll pass for $10+ per day, even if you'll only
          hit one toll road, or none at all.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Research your route ahead of time. If tolls are limited, decline the
          pass.
          <br /> Bring your own transponder or pay cash where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some companies now offer pay-per-use toll systems but usually only
          worth it only if you're crossing toll zones regularly.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      </div>{" "}
      <div>
        <h2>Credit Card Holds That Don't Release</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          A “temporary hold” of $500 or more appears on your card, and it takes
          weeks to clear, sometimes after you're home.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Ask about the hold amount and release timeframe before you book.
          <br /> Major brands disclose their hold policies clearly online.
          <br /> If you want faster refunds, stick with digital-first platforms
          that process payments instantly at drop-off.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      </div>{" "}
      <div>
        <h2>The “Free Upgrade” That Isn't</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          At the counter, you're told your vehicle class isn't available, but
          they can “upgrade” you for a price buried in the fine print.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Confirm the total cost before you agree to any change. If the upgrade
          isn't free, decline. <br />

      </div>{" "}
      <div>
        <h2>Mileage Limit Surprises</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          Your “unlimited mileage” rental turns out to have a cap, and every
          extra mile costs up to $1.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Check mileage limits before booking and screenshot the terms. Confirm
          whether or not you are really getting the miles that you are paying
          for.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />

      <div>
        <h2>Extras You Didn't Request</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          You find charges for GPS units, child seats, or add-ons you never
          requested. Turns out they are pre-checked boxes buried in your
          contract.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Read every page of your rental agreement before signing. Cross out or
          decline any add-ons you didn't authorize.
          <br /> Most online booking systems show an itemized price breakdown so
          you can uncheck extras ahead of time.

        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      </div>{" "}
      <div>
        <h2>Refusing Debit or Prepaid Cards at Pickup</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          This one isn't as common: You book online with a debit or prepaid
          card, but at pick up the agent says, “credit cards only,” leaving you
          stranded or forcing you into a higher priced plan.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Always check the company's payment policy before confirming.
          <br /> Many major brands now accept debit cards with proof of travel
          itinerary.
          <br /> If you primarily use debit, filter for “Debit Card Friendly”
          rentals or book through peer networks which typically accept more
          payment types.

      <div>
        <h2>The Bait and Switch Vehicle</h2>
        <h3>The Scam:</h3>
        <p>
          You book a nice sedan or SUV online but arrive to find only compact
          cars are available.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Avoid It:</h3>
        <p>
          Ask for confirmation of your exact model or category before arrival.
          <br />
          Stick with companies that guarantee inventory accuracy.
