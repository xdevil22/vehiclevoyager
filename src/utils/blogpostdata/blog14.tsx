        <h2>A Brief History of the WM Phoenix Open</h2>

        <p>
          The Phoenix Open dates back to 1932, making it one of the
          longest-running professional golf tournaments in the United States.
          Over the decades, it evolved from a traditional desert golf event into
          one of the most recognizable stops on the PGA Tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tournament's transformation accelerated in the late 1990s and
          early 2000s, when organizers embraced a more energetic, fan-forward
          experience. That shift culminated in what the event is now famous for:
          packed grandstands, loud crowds, and an atmosphere that feels closer
          to a sporting festival than a country-club gallery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the WM Phoenix Open consistently ranks as the most attended
          golf tournament in the world.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How Big Is the WM Phoenix Open?</h2>

        <p>Massive, by any standard.</p>

        <p>
          The tournament regularly draws over 500,000 fans over four days,
          dwarfing attendance numbers at most other PGA Tour events. Peak days
          see tens of thousands of spectators on-site, creating an atmosphere
          that's unmatched in professional golf.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets the Phoenix Open apart isn’t just attendance, but
          engagement. Fans are encouraged to cheer, react, and participate.
          Especially in the tournament’s most famous location.

      <div>
        <h2>The Iconic 16th Hole</h2>

        <p>
          No discussion of the WM Phoenix Open is complete without the 16th hole
          at TPC Scottsdale.
        </p>

        <p>
          Often called the loudest hole in golf, the par-3 16th is surrounded by
          a fully enclosed stadium that seats thousands of fans. Players are
          booed, cheered, and serenaded as they tee off, creating a
          pressure-packed moment unlike anything else on the PGA Tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hole-in-ones here are legendary, often triggering roars that can be
          heard across the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hole alone has helped turn the Phoenix Open into a bucket-list
          sporting event.

        <h2>The Wildest Moment in Phoenix Open History</h2>

        <p>
          If there's one moment that perfectly captures why the WM Phoenix Open
          is unlike any other golf tournament in the world, it happened on the
          16th hole in 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
          That year, a young Tiger Woods stepped onto the tee at the now-famous
          par-3 stadium hole. As the crowd buzzed and noise echoed through the
          grandstands, Woods struck his shot and watched it roll straight into
          the cup for a hole-in-one.
        </p>
        <p>What happened next has become legendary.</p>
        <p>
          The crowd erupted into chaos. Beer cups rained down onto the green.
          Fans screamed, jumped, and celebrated as if they were at a playoff
          game rather than a golf tournament. Security struggled to clear the
          putting surface, and the delay lasted several minutes before play
          could resume.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this day, that moment is widely regarded as the wildest shot in PGA
          Tour history.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't just the ace itself; it was the reaction. The 16th hole
          officially became known as <i>the loudest hole in golf</i>, and the
          Phoenix Open embraced its reputation from that moment forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, several other hole-in-ones at the 16th have triggered
          similar scenes, but none have surpassed the shockwave created by
          Woods' shot in 1997. It set the tone for everything the tournament
          would become: loud, electric, unpredictable, and unapologetically fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many fans, witnessing even a fraction of that energy in person is
          reason enough to make the trip to Scottsdale.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>How to Attend the Tournament as a Spectator</h2>
        <p>
          One of the best things about the WM Phoenix Open is how accessible it
          is to fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't need a VIP badge to enjoy the tournament. General admission
          tickets grant access to the course, fan zones, concessions, and
          multiple viewing areas.
        </p>
        <h3>Tickets and Admission</h3>
        <p>Ticket options typically include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Single-day general admission </li>
          <li>Multi-day passes</li>
          <li>Premium hospitality packages</li>
          <li>VIP suites and sponsored lounges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Saturday and Sunday sell out quickly, so buying tickets in advance
          through authorized sellers is highly recommended.
        </p>

        <h2>Premium Experiences and Signature Events at the WM Phoenix Open</h2>
        <p>
          One of the reasons the Waste Management Phoenix Open stands apart from
          every other stop on the PGA Tour is the sheer variety of premium
          experiences, hospitality packages, and on-course entertainment
          available throughout tournament week.
        </p>
        <p>
          From all-inclusive hospitality suites to stadium-style party zones and
          post-round concerts, the Phoenix Open offers far more than standard
          gallery access.
        </p>
        <h3>General Admission vs. Hospitality Access</h3>
        <p>
          General admission tickets allow fans to walk the course, follow
          groups, and access fan zones throughout TPC Scottsdale. But many
          travelers opt to upgrade to one of the tournament’s hospitality
          experiences, which offer better views, shorter lines, and a more
          social atmosphere.

        <h2>Daily and Weekly Hospitality Tickets</h2>
        <p>
          For fans who want an elevated experience without committing to a
          private suite, daily and weekly hospitality tickets strike a balance
          between comfort and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daily hospitality passes are ideal for visitors attending one or two
          days, while weekly hospitality options appeal to travelers staying for
          the full tournament and want consistent access to premium viewing
          areas.

        <h2>Hospitality Suites and Cabanas</h2>
        <p>
          At the top end of the experience spectrum are hospitality suites and
          cabanas, which offer a private or semi-private setting overlooking
          some of the most exciting parts of the course.
        </p>
        <p>These options are especially popular with:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Corporate groups</li>

        <h2>Coors Light Birds Nest</h2>

        <p>
          The Coors Light Birds Nest is one of the most recognizable off-course
          attractions at the Phoenix Open.
        </p>
        <p>
          This nighttime concert venue hosts major music acts throughout
          tournament week, turning the event into a full day-to-night
          experience. For four nights every year the hottest nightclub in
          Scottsdale is located inside a tent erected in north Scottsdale. Birds
          Nest tickets are sold separately from golf admission and are
          especially popular with younger crowds and visitors looking to combine
          golf with nightlife.
        </p>

        <p>
          For many attendees, the Birds Nest is just as much a draw as the
          tournament itself.

        <p>
          Another unique experience offered during tournament week is the
          Concert in the Coliseum, which brings live music directly into the
          heart of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          These concerts take place inside the tournament grounds and offer a
          stadium-style atmosphere that blends golf, music, and crowd energy in
          a way few sporting events can match.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tickets are typically limited and often bundled with premium access

        <h2>Getting Around Scottsdale During the Tournament</h2>
        <p>Transportation planning is critical during WM Phoenix Open week.</p>
        <p>
          Ride-share demand surges, parking is limited, and traffic near TPC
          Scottsdale can be heavy during peak hours.
        </p>
        <p>Popular options include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Standard car rentals for flexibility</li>
          <li>Luxury and exotic car rentals</li>
          <li>Chauffeured or premium transport services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many visitors also extend their stay to explore Sedona, Cave Creek, or
          the Sonoran Desert, making a rental vehicle especially useful.
