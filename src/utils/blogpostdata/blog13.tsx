        Every January, Scottsdale, Arizona becomes the epicenter of the
        collector-car world as Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale, the most famous
        automotive auction in the United States, returns for its flagship event.
        What began as a niche collector gathering has grown into a globally
        televised spectacle drawing hundreds of thousands of attendees,
        thousands of vehicles, celebrities, and some of the highest hammer
        prices ever recorded.

        Whether you're attending as a spectator, a bidder, a seller, or simply a
        traveler drawn by the energy of the event, Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale is
        far more than an auction, it's a full-scale automotive and lifestyle
        experience. This guide covers the history of the auction, how to

        <h2>A Brief History of Barrett-Jackson</h2>

        <div>
          <img
            src={BASE_URL + tombarrett1971}
            alt="canyon helicopter"

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Barrett-Jackson was founded in 1971 by Tom Barrett and Russ Jackson,
          both passionate collectors who envisioned an auction built around
          transparency, excitement, and high-quality vehicles. Unlike
          traditional collector auctions that catered to small, elite circles,
          Barrett-Jackson embraced public attendance and live bidding, helping
          bring car collecting into the mainstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1971 at their Scottsdale auction, two of the star vehicles that
          were included were a pair of Barrett's Mercedes-Benz 770 Phaetons,
          like the one above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scottsdale auction quickly became the centerpiece of the brand.
          Over the decades, Barrett-Jackson has helped redefine the
          collector-car market, popularizing categories like American muscle
          cars, resto-mods, and modern performance vehicles while maintaining
          strict vehicle vetting standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the Scottsdale event is not only Barrett-Jackson's largest
          auction, it's widely considered the most important collector-car
          auction of the year.

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The Scottsdale auction typically features 1,700 to 2,000 vehicles over
          the course of about a week. These include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Classic American muscle cars</li>
          <li>Vintage European sports cars</li>
          <li>Modern exotics and supercars</li>
          <li>Celebrity-owned vehicles</li>
          <li>Custom builds and resto-mods</li>
          <li>Trucks, SUVs, and specialty vehicles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Attendance often exceeds 300,000 people throughout the event, with
          peak days drawing massive crowds and global media coverage. The scale
          is part of what makes Scottsdale unique, there's always something
          happening, even outside the main auction lanes.

        <h3>The Most Expensive Car Ever Sold at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale</h3>

        <p>
          One of the most talked-about moments in Barrett-Jackson history
          occurred at the Scottsdale auction when a 1966 Shelby Cobra 427 “Super
          Snake” sold for $5.5 million, making it the most expensive vehicle
          ever auctioned by Barrett-Jackson.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car was one of only two Super Snakes ever built and had direct
          ties to Carroll Shelby himself. Moments like this are part of what
          keeps collectors, investors, and enthusiasts returning year after
          year. Scottsdale is where automotive history can literally change
          hands.

        <h2>How to Participate as a Bidder</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to bid on a vehicle, you'll need to register as a bidder
          in advance. This includes:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Completing a bidder application</li>
          <li>Providing identification and financial verification</li>
          <li>Paying a bidder registration fee</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once approved, you'll receive bidding credentials and can participate
          either in person or, in some cases, remotely. Buyers should also
          factor in the buyer's premium, which is added to the final hammer
          price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barrett-Jackson's reputation for transparency and vehicle quality
          makes it appealing to both first-time buyers and seasoned collectors.

        <h3>How to Auction Your Own Vehicle at Barrett-Jackson</h3>
        <p>
          Selling a vehicle at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale is a prestigious
          opportunity, but not every car is accepted. Vehicles must go through a
          submission and vetting process to ensure they meet the auction's
          standards and align with buyer demand.
        </p>
        <p>The process typically involves:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
          <li>Submitting vehicle details and photos</li>
          <li>Receiving acceptance from Barrett-Jackson</li>
          <li>Choosing a reserve or no-reserve format</li>
          <li>Paying consignment and entry fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many sellers choose Scottsdale specifically because of its massive
          audience and media exposure, which can help drive strong bidding
          results.
