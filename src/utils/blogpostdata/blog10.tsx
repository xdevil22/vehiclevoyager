        Some sights are too spectacular to experience from the ground. That's
        where a helicopter tour comes in ‚Äî giving you front-row seats to
        landscapes most travelers only glimpse from postcards.
      </p>
      <p>
        From red rock canyons to turquoise coastlines, here are four
        destinations where a flight is <em>the</em> experience you'll talk about
        for years.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Grand Canyon Helicopter Tours</h2>
      <div className="text-center">

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Few places on Earth are as jaw-dropping from above as the Grand Canyon.
        A helicopter flight lets you truly grasp the scale ‚Äî mile-wide chasms,
        layered rock formations, and the mighty Colorado River twisting through
        the desert floor.
      </p>

          className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
          Many flights
        </a>{" "}
        depart directly from Las Vegas, so you can go from city lights to
        natural wonder in a single day. Some tours even land on the canyon floor
        for a champagne toast.
        <em>
          (Tip: Sunset flights offer the most dramatic lighting ‚Äî golden cliffs
          that glow as the sun dips below the rim.)
        </em>
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6 border-t-2 border-gray-400" />
      <h2>2. Las Vegas Strip & Red Rock Canyon</h2>
      <div className="text-center">
        <img
          src={BASE_URL + redrockcanyon}
          alt="red rock canyon"
          className="inline-block"
          loading="lazy"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        If the Grand Canyon is nature's masterpiece, the Las Vegas Strip is its
        neon counterpart. A nighttime helicopter ride gives you a bird's-eye
        view of every landmark ‚Äî the Bellagio fountains, the Sphere, and the
        endless desert glow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daytime tours also head out to Red Rock Canyon, where sandstone peaks
        contrast against the city skyline ‚Äî a perfect mix of natural and
        man-made spectacle.

      <h2>3. Maui, Hawaii</h2>
      <div className="text-center">
        <img
          src={BASE_URL + mauihawaii}

          loading="lazy"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        In Maui, a helicopter tour isn't just a thrill ‚Äî it's practically a rite
        of passage. You'll glide over waterfalls that tumble hundreds of feet,
        the lush valleys of Iao, and the volcanic crater of HaleakalƒÅ.
        <br />
        Unlike road trips that take hours, a helicopter lets you see every side
        of the island in one breathtaking loop.

        tallest in the world.

      <h2>4. Catalina Island, California</h2>
      <div className="text-center">

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Just a short hop off the Southern California coast, Catalina Island is
        already a peaceful escape ‚Äî but from above, it's something else
        entirely.
